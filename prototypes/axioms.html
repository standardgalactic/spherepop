  <h2>Axioms and Theorems</h2>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS is defined by a small number of axioms.
    All system properties follow as theorems or corollaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page states the core axioms explicitly and records the
    principal results they entail.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Ontology</h2>

  <h3>Axiom O1 (Semantic Objects)</h3>
  <p>
    A semantic object is an abstract handle with no intrinsic meaning.
    Objects acquire meaning only through relations, equivalence, and
    the event history that produced them.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom O2 (Relational Primacy)</h3>
  <p>
    All semantic structure arises from typed relations between objects
    and from equivalence relations induced by events.
  </p>

  <h3>Corollary O2.1</h3>
  <p>
    There exists no authoritative object table independent of replay.
    Objects exist only as derived consequences of the event log.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Authority and Time</h2>

  <h3>Axiom T1 (Append-Only Authority)</h3>
  <p>
    All authoritative semantic state transitions are recorded as events
    in a single append-only log.
    No other mechanism may introduce or modify authoritative state.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom T2 (Total Causal Order)</h3>
  <p>
    Every event in the log is assigned a unique position in a total order.
    This order is global and unambiguous.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem T2.1 (Well-Defined Time)</h3>
  <p>
    Semantic time in Spherepop OS is isomorphic to log prefix order.
    There is no notion of “current state” independent of a prefix.
  </p>

  <h3>Corollary T2.2</h3>
  <p>
    Two observers referring to the same log prefix necessarily refer
    to the same semantic state, regardless of transport or representation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Kernel Semantics</h2>

  <h3>Axiom K1 (Deterministic Kernel)</h3>
  <p>
    The kernel is a deterministic transition system.
    For any derived state σ and event e, there exists at most one σ′
    such that σ —e→ σ′.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom K2 (No Hidden State)</h3>
  <p>
    The kernel maintains no hidden or mutable state beyond that
    derivable from replay of the event log.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem K2.1 (Deterministic Replay)</h3>
  <p>
    Given an initial empty state and a log prefix ℓ,
    replay yields a unique derived state σℓ.
  </p>

  <h3>Corollary K2.2</h3>
  <p>
    Any cache, index, or materialized view may be discarded and
    reconstructed without semantic loss.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Equivalence and Canonicalization</h2>

  <h3>Axiom E1 (Event-Induced Equivalence)</h3>
  <p>
    Equivalence between objects is induced exclusively by MERGE
    or COLLAPSE events.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom E2 (Representative Normalization)</h3>
  <p>
    All relations are stored and interpreted in representative-normalized
    form with respect to the induced equivalence relation.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem E2.1 (Merge Confluence)</h3>
  <p>
    The final equivalence relation induced by a set of MERGE events
    is independent of their order.
  </p>

  <h3>Corollary E2.2</h3>
  <p>
    Canonical representatives are stable under replay and transport.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Views and Non-Interference</h2>

  <h3>Axiom V1 (View–Cause Separation)</h3>
  <p>
    Views are derived representations of kernel state and may not
    introduce or modify authoritative events.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom V2 (Non-Interference)</h3>
  <p>
    Dropping, reordering, or recomputing views does not affect
    authoritative semantics.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem V2.1 (Snapshot Purity)</h3>
  <p>
    A snapshot introduces no information not already present
    in the log prefix it represents.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem V2.2 (Replay Equivalence)</h3>
  <p>
    Incremental observation via diffs is semantically equivalent
    to full replay from the log prefix.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Functorial Semantics</h2>

  <h3>Axiom F1 (Prefix Category)</h3>
  <p>
    Log prefixes form a category whose objects are prefix lengths
    and whose morphisms are prefix extensions.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom F2 (State Semantics Functor)</h3>
  <p>
    Replay defines a functor from the prefix category into the
    category of kernel states.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem F2.1 (Functoriality of Replay)</h3>
  <p>
    Replay respects identity and composition.
    Sequential event application corresponds to morphism composition.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem F2.2 (Functorial Views)</h3>
  <p>
    Any admissible view factors functorially through replay.
    View updates therefore respect causal order by construction.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Speculation</h2>

  <h3>Axiom S1 (Speculative Isolation)</h3>
  <p>
    Speculative events exist only in local overlay logs and have
    no effect on authoritative state unless explicitly committed.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem S1.1</h3>
  <p>
    Speculation cannot corrupt or destabilize the authoritative timeline.
  </p>

  <h3>Corollary S1.2</h3>
  <p>
    Exploratory reasoning and counterfactual analysis are safe operations.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Geometry and Metadata</h2>

  <h3>Axiom G1 (Geometry as Metadata)</h3>
  <p>
    Layout, position, and visualization hints are metadata and
    are not interpreted as semantic constraints.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem G1.1 (Gauge Freedom)</h3>
  <p>
    Two views differing only in geometric metadata are semantically
    equivalent.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS is not defined by features but by invariants.
    Its axioms enforce determinism, causal clarity, and semantic stability.
    Everything else—tools, interfaces, utilities—is a derived consequence.
