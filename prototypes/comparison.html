  <h2>Comparative Positioning</h2>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS is best understood not as a refinement of existing operating systems
    or databases, but as a reorganization of where <em>authority</em>, <em>time</em>,
    and <em>meaning</em> are allowed to live.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>POSIX and Traditional Operating Systems</h2>

  <p>
    POSIX-style operating systems organize computation around
    <b>mutable global state</b>:
    files, processes, memory pages, and kernel-managed side effects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Time in such systems is implicit and operational:
    the current state is “what exists now,” and past states are not
    reconstructible except through ad hoc logging.
  </p>

  <h3>Key properties</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>State mutation is primary</li>
    <li>Concurrency is resolved operationally (locks, schedulers)</li>
    <li>Introspection is partial and lossy</li>
    <li>Reproducibility is external to the model</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spherepop OS contrast</h3>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS forbids hidden mutation.
    All authoritative change is explicit, time-ordered, and replayable.
    The kernel has no side effects and no privileged “now.”
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>CRDTs and Eventual Consistency Systems</h2>

  <p>
    CRDT-based systems abandon total order in favor of
    <b>commutative convergence</b>.
    Multiple replicas apply operations independently and
    reconcile via algebraic properties.
  </p>

  <p>
    This design is well-suited for high-availability systems,
    but it weakens causal clarity and makes global reasoning difficult.
  </p>

  <h3>Key properties</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No single authoritative timeline</li>
    <li>Convergence without total order</li>
    <li>Causality is partial and replica-relative</li>
    <li>Semantic conflicts are absorbed, not inspected</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spherepop OS contrast</h3>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS chooses the opposite tradeoff:
    a single authoritative log with a total causal order.
    Concurrency exists only at the level of observers and speculation,
    never at the level of committed semantics.
  </p>

  <p>
    This makes causality explicit, inspectable, and mathematically rigid.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Git and Version Control Systems</h2>

  <p>
    Git models history explicitly, but only at the granularity of
    <b>commits over file trees</b>.
    Between commits, state is mutable and untracked.
  </p>

  <p>
    Branching and merging are first-class,
    but replay semantics are informal and tool-dependent.
  </p>

  <h3>Key properties</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>History is explicit but coarse-grained</li>
    <li>Merges are semantic guesses, not canonical rewrites</li>
    <li>Time exists only at commit boundaries</li>
    <li>Runtime state is outside the model</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spherepop OS contrast</h3>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS generalizes version control to
    <b>all semantic operations</b>.
    Every rewrite is time-indexed; equivalence is canonicalized
    by construction; speculation is continuous, not commit-based.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this sense, Spherepop OS can be seen as
    “version control for meaning rather than files.”
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Event Sourcing (Conventional)</h2>

  <p>
    Event-sourced architectures record changes as logs,
    but typically treat the log as an implementation detail.
    Derived state is often allowed to drift or be partially authoritative.
  </p>

  <h3>Spherepop OS distinction</h3>
  <p>
    In Spherepop OS, the log is not an optimization or audit trail.
    It <em>is</em> the system.
    No cache, index, or view is permitted to outrank replay.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Summary Table (Conceptual)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>POSIX</b>: mutable state first, time implicit</li>
    <li><b>CRDT</b>: convergence first, causality weakened</li>
    <li><b>Git</b>: history explicit, runtime excluded</li>
    <li><b>Event sourcing</b>: log secondary</li>
    <li><b>Spherepop OS</b>: log primary, time explicit, semantics canonical</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Why Spherepop OS exists</h2>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS is designed for environments where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>time must be inspectable</li>
    <li>collaboration must be deterministic</li>
    <li>speculation must be safe</li>
    <li>geometry must not smuggle semantics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is not a drop-in replacement for existing systems,
    but a substrate for semantic computation under explicit time.
