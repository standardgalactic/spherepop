  <h2>Extension Axioms</h2>
  <p>
    This page records conservative extensions to the core axioms of Spherepop OS.
    Each extension preserves determinism, replayability, and semantic primacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    No extension is required for the core system to remain well-defined.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Principle of Conservative Extension</h2>

  <h3>Axiom X0 (Conservativity)</h3>
  <p>
    Any extension to Spherepop OS must preserve all core axioms.
    In particular, no extension may introduce hidden state, causal ambiguity,
    or alternative sources of authority.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extensions may add structure, not power.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Distributed Arbitration</h2>

  <h3>Axiom D1 (Logical Single Sequencer)</h3>
  <p>
    Even in a distributed deployment, there exists a logical single sequencer
    whose output defines the authoritative total order of events.
  </p>

  <p>
    Physical implementation may be replicated or fault-tolerant, but the
    observable log order must be indistinguishable from a single source.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem D1.1</h3>
  <p>
    Distributed arbitration is observationally equivalent to a single arbiter
    provided that the emitted event sequence is totally ordered and immutable.
  </p>

  <h3>Corollary D1.2</h3>
  <p>
    Consensus protocols may be used internally without altering kernel semantics.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Entropy-Aware Scheduling</h2>

  <h3>Axiom EΣ1 (Entropy as Metadata)</h3>
  <p>
    Measures of entropy, cost, or uncertainty may be attached to events or objects
    as metadata, provided they do not influence kernel transitions.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom EΣ2 (Advisory Influence Only)</h3>
  <p>
    Entropy annotations may guide scheduling, visualization, or prioritization,
    but may not alter the meaning or order of committed events.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem EΣ2.1</h3>
  <p>
    Entropy-aware scheduling preserves deterministic replay so long as entropy
    values are treated as non-causal annotations.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Typed Semantic Relations</h2>

  <h3>Axiom TΣ1 (Type Enrichment)</h3>
  <p>
    Relation types may be extended with richer internal structure
    (e.g. arity, constraints, annotations), provided normalization
    remains representative-based.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom TΣ2 (Type Erasure for Replay)</h3>
  <p>
    The kernel must admit a type-erased interpretation sufficient
    to replay all events deterministically.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem TΣ2.1</h3>
  <p>
    Type enrichment does not affect replay equivalence if erasure
    preserves event identity and order.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Higher-Order Events</h2>

  <h3>Axiom H1 (Events About Events)</h3>
  <p>
    Events may reference other events (e.g. annotations, justification,
    provenance) provided such references do not alter prior semantics.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom H2 (Non-Retroactivity)</h3>
  <p>
    No event may retroactively modify the semantic effect of a
    previously committed event.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem H2.1</h3>
  <p>
    Provenance, explanation, and commentary layers may be added
    without violating determinism.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Semantic Compression and Summarization</h2>

  <h3>Axiom C1 (Derived Summaries)</h3>
  <p>
    Summaries, compressions, or abstractions of event history
    are admissible only as derived views.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom C2 (Loss Transparency)</h3>
  <p>
    Any lossy summary must declare its loss model explicitly
    and remain traceable to the authoritative log.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem C2.1</h3>
  <p>
    Semantic compression does not compromise correctness if
    the authoritative log remains available for inspection.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Interoperation with External Systems</h2>

  <h3>Axiom I1 (Boundary Explicitness)</h3>
  <p>
    Any interaction with external systems must cross an explicit
    boundary that converts side effects into proposed events.
  </p>

  <h3>Axiom I2 (No Hidden Authority)</h3>
  <p>
    External systems may not be treated as authoritative sources
    of semantic truth.
  </p>

  <h3>Theorem I2.1</h3>
  <p>
    Side-effectful environments may be safely interfaced with
    Spherepop OS by treating effects as observations or proposals.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="prose">
  <h2>Summary of Extension Discipline</h2>
  <p>
    Spherepop OS grows by accretion, not mutation.
    Extensions add structure while preserving the invariants
    that make deterministic collaboration possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any system that violates these extension axioms
    is no longer a Spherepop system.
