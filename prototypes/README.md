# Spherepop: Geometric Merge–Collapse Computation

This repository contains reference implementations and documentation for the
Spherepop model of computation in three languages:

- Racket (with typed interface and Scribble docs)
- Python
- Haskell

It also includes LaTeX sources for the conceptual paper *Computing with Spherepop*
and language‑specific tutorials.

This is a **research / teaching prototype**, not a production library.
APIs are intentionally small and easy to read so that the semantics remain clear.
