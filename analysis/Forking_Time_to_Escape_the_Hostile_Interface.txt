I want to start today with a feeling and I know I know talking about feelings isn't usually how we
kick off a deep dive into you know tech and economics but just bear with me for a second
okay I'm listening you know that specific sinking sensation when you've been scrolling for maybe
20-30 minutes oh yeah the doom scroll paralysis I know it well right but it's more than that it's
not just that you're wasting time it's this uh creeping suspicion and I've been feeling this a
lot lately that the app isn't just indifferent to you it feels like it's actually fighting you
like the interface itself has become I don't know hostile hostile is the exact word and frankly if
you feel like you're in a fight with your phone it's because you are you're the opponent that is
a terrifying thought to start the day I mean I'm just trying to see what my friends are up to or
maybe catch up on some news but the interface is actively throwing obstacles in my way right
it's all these weird ads rage beat drop ship garbage that looks like it was made in a blender
it really feels like I'm in a boxing match for my own attentions Dan that feeling is not paranoia
it is a measurable quantifiable shift in the architecture of the internet we are seeing a
transition from tools that are meant to serve users to systems that are designed to harvest them
well that is a perfect if slightly horrifying lead-in to today's deep dive we are looking at two absolute
blockbusters that just dropped on January 19, 2026 thereby an author known only as Flixium
a very mysterious but I mean an incredibly technical voice we don't really know who they are but they
clearly have a deep deep background in distributed systems and behavioral economics yeah these are not
just you know blog posts about social media being bad these are dense structural analyses the first
paper is called the hostile interface which I mean it diagnoses exactly why our screens have turned into
these battlefields it covers everything from the economics of what they call in shittification
to something called cognitive occlusion and the second paper that is the real heavy hitter it's
called the fork ability of time which honestly sounds like a sci-fi novel it kind of reads like a physics
thesis mixed with the legal constitution it's actually a technical proposal for a whole new system called
sphere pop sphere pop okay and it aims to break these platform monopolies by doing something truly
mind-bending making time and history forkable okay so the mission for us today is to connect these
dots we're going to walk through the diagnosis why the apps degrade and why it feels so gross to use them
right now then the trap then the trap why we can't just delete them and that's going to bring us to the
technical solution sphere pop this exit protocol and this wild idea of causal sovereignty and finally and
this is a really cool part we'll see how this all connects back to the physical world how making
our digital history legible might actually help solve physical pollution it's a journey from the
economics of frustration to the physics of freedom I love that that's it okay let's start with the pain
the hostile interface so flixting opens with this concept called the incentive inversion
now I think most people get that companies need to make money we aren't naive but this paper argues
something fundamental has changed in the business model it tracks the life cycle of what economists call
a two-sided market in the beginning a platform think early Facebook early Instagram early TikTok
has users on one side and advertisers on the other right but on day one they don't care about the
advertisers at all they are desperate for us that's the honeymoon phase I remember early Instagram
there were no ads it was just chronological photos of my friends lunches it was peaceful exactly to get
those network effects rolling they subsidize the user experience they literally burn venture capital
money to give you a clean interface high quality connections zero friction they're paying for us to be
there at that stage they're maximizing network value they need you to be happy so you'll bring your
friends the user is the prize right because if the app sucked in 2012 nobody would have joined
but then inevitably everyone is on the platform my grandma's on the platform yeah the growth just
stops because there are no more humans left in the country to sign up saturation and this is where
the inversion happens they can no longer grow by adding new users so the math the shareholder demand
forces them to grow by extracting more revenue per user the optimization function flips it flips
completely so instead of how do we make this cool and useful for the user it becomes how much money can
we possibly squeeze out of this person before they get angry enough to quit precisely the social graph
you know your memories your inside jokes with friends your connections that stops being the product
they're building it becomes the input it becomes the raw material for the extraction machine the paper calls
it beat it is bait they use your own connections to lure you into a behavioral marketplace but here's the key
insight from fliction and this answers your question about why it feels so hostile it's not just they show you
ads it's that the quality of the ads completely collapses okay this is something i've noticed so much and i honestly
thought i was going crazy five maybe six years ago the ads were for i don't know legitimate car companies
movie trailers maybe a nice pair of sneakers sure real brands now it's bizarre medical devices obvious
scams mobile games that don't even look like real games and just weird goo in a jar yeah why did the quality
tank so hard this is pure economics fliction references a classic uh a nobel winning paper
by george acreloff called the market for lemons okay bring me back to ecom 101 this is about used cars
right right the theory goes like this in a used car market you have good cars which he calls peaches
and bad cars the lemons okay if a buyer can't tell the difference if there's no way to verify the quality
before you buy they won't be willing to pay a premium price they just have to assume that every
car might be a lemon so you average down your offer so if i have a really nice car to sell a real peach
but i can't prove it's nice i can't get a good price for it exactly so what do you do i wouldn't sell it
i'd leave the market you leave the market the sellers of good cars pull out because the environment
doesn't reward quality which leaves only the lemons only the scammers yes fliction argues this is
exactly what has happened to our social feeds platforms like facebook and others they removed
all the quality constraints to lower the barrier to entry for advertisers they wanted to juice the
auction just get more bidders in the room to drive up the price per pixel they let anyone with a credit
card bid on my attention anyone but by letting anyone in they created a low trust environment
assess pool basically the high agency advertisers you know the brands that care about their reputation
the ones selling the peaches they look at this swamp of drop shippers fake ai dating apps and political
rage bait and they just say oh i'm not putting my logo next to that no way so they reduce their spend
or they leave entirely and the vacuum is immediately filled by the bottom of the barrel
scammers ideological operators fly by night sellers precisely these actors don't care about long-term
reputation they care about short-term extraction they're the only ones who are willing to play in a
hostile interface that explains the weirdness so perfectly it's an adverse selection spiral but there's a
darker more psychological layer here too the paper talks about something called the poverty multiplier
this section really hit me hard because it frames the ads not just as annoying but as i mean as
predatory it is a profound point if you have disposable income these bad ads are just a nuisance right
you scroll past the weird drop ship gadget and you don't think twice right it's just noise
but for users with less money or users who are in some kind of financial distress the interface
weaponizes scarcity against them it's constantly showing you the good life that you can't have
or it's offering you these cheap quick fixes for really complex problems constantly and the paper
argues this isn't accidental frustration is a massive driver of interaction the system works because it
creates a desire gap it makes you feel wanting it keeps you in the state of low-level agitation so the
bad feelings are actually a feature not a bug the system wants you to feel insecure so you'll click
on the thing that promises a solution which leads us directly to the concept of behavioral spam and we
need to be really clear about this that this is not the spam we're used to right not email spam no we know
what email spam is the nigerian prince the click here for a prize you see it you filter it it's distinct
from the real messages yeah it's it's in my junk folder i never even see it but behavioral spam is
different it's camouflaged it mimics the aesthetics of a friend's post it mimics the look and feel of a
news article it's woven directly into the social fabric so my brain has to burn mental energy just to
figure out what i'm even looking at i'm scrolling and i have to make this split second decision is this
my cousin's new baby or is this an ai generated image that's trying to get me to click a sketchy link
and that micro decision that burns glucose fliction calls it the transfer of the burden of discrimination
the burden of discrimination yeah the platform used to filter this stuff for you that was part of their
job to create a good experience now to save money and boost engagement metrics they offload that filtering
costs directly to your brain that is why i feel so tired after scrolling yes you aren't reading your
feed you are dodging landmines it is attentional fatigue you are performing high-speed cognitive
sorting in an actively hostile environment and your brain is paying the metabolic price for it which is a
perfect bridge to the second major pillar of the diagnosis the cognitive crisis it's not just that we're
tired fliction argues this interface is actually breaking our ability to think deeply it breaks the
architecture of thought the paper draws a sharp contrast between two models the feed versus the search
search feels almost old school now doesn't it like going to a library but what's the deep structural difference
search is demand driven you have a question you initiate the action you are the protagonist in the story
how do i fix my sink what is the capital of peru i'm in control you're in control the system waits for
you it responds to you it respects your mental state because it is by design passive until it's called
upon and the feed the feed is supply driven it manufactures need it tells you what you should want before you
even knew you wanted it but the real damage the cognitive damage comes from how it disrupts a
process called conceptual blending okay this was the dense cognitive science part of the paper you have
to break down conceptual blending for us in like plain english okay think about how you understand a simple
metaphor or how you solve a complex problem let's take a metaphor that surgeon is a butcher okay to understand
that your brain has to hold the concept of surgeon which is you know someone who heals precise sterile
and the concept of butcher someone who cuts meat is maybe a bit rough bloody it has to hold both of
those ideas in your head at the same time and i have to mix them i take the idea of cutting from the butcher
and i apply it to the doctor context to get the meaning sloppy doctor exactly that mixing process requires a
stable mental workspace you need what the paper calls a coherent conceptual manifold you need dwell time
you need a few seconds for your brain to load both of those contacts and let them merge and the feed
denies you that time it denies you that time completely it acts as a stochastic forcing function
i love that term stochastic forcing function even though it sounds like something that would
i don't know kill you in a physics experiment stochastic just means random forcing means it's pushing
you from the outside the feed injects completely unrelated contexts a cute cat video then immediately
a video of a war crime then an ad for soap then a political outrage meme at a rate that is faster than
your brain can perform the blend so i'm trying to load the cat context aww cute but before i can even really
settle into that feeling i'm forced into war then immediately into soap my brain doesn't know what
to do your brain never settles it never completes the blend it's just constant cognitive interrupt
handling fliction argues that deep creative reasoning becomes mathematically impossible under these
conditions why mathematically impossible because the context window of your mind keeps getting flushed
before you can build a complex thought from multiple stable parts it's like trying to cook a gourmet meal
but every 10 seconds someone runs into the kitchen and just throws a random ingredient into the pot a
fish then some chocolate then a tire you know get dinner you just get sludge cognitive pollution we're
actively degrading our own ability to make sense of the world because the interface we used to see it
won't let us think okay so the interface is hostile the economics favor scammers and our brains are being
turned into scrambled eggs the obvious question and this is what i found myself just screaming at the
paper while i was reading it is why don't we just leave ah the exit problem just delete the app go
outside touch grass why are we still here this is the pivot to the second paper the fork ability of time
and the answer affliction gives is i think fascinating we can't leave because the platforms hold a monopoly on
sequence this was the mind blower for me i always thought their power was in network effects you know
everyone is there so i have to be there too yeah but affliction says no it's actually about time yes
we tend to think platforms own the content i posted the photo so i own the photo but what they really
truly own is the order in which events become real they own the timeline the order in which events
become real unpack that for me that sounds very profound okay if you leave facebook right now what
happens you can download your data they are you know legally required to give it to you you get a
big zip file of photos and maybe some messy text files i've actually done this it's a digital graveyard
it's just a folder full of disconnected files it's meaningless exactly you have the artifacts but you lose
the history you lose the causal thread the comments the likes the back and forth conversation the context
of when things happen and in what order they happened you cannot take that timeline and just plug it into
a different app right i can't take my entire facebook history and just load it into twitter or blue ski
it's totally incompatible the history is trapped there and that is social death your digital reality is
rented from the institution if you decide to leave the landlord you have to leave your entire life
behind you functionally cease to exist in the shared timeline of your community so we stay in the hostile
interface because the alternative is to to cease to exist socially that feels like a hostage situation
it is a hostage situation but fliction proposes a way to negotiate the release of the hostages
this is where c pop comes in sphere pop it sounds like a soda but the paper describes it as a
history first computational substrate so this is the big technical solution how does it fix the
problem of social death the core insight of sphere pop is that state meaning your profile your current
friend list the way the world looks right now it's just a derivative of history okay help me visualize
that state versus history think of a chess game currently social media just shows you the board
here's where all the pieces are right now that's the state but sphere pop says no the most important
thing is the list of moves the log pawn to e4 knight to c3 that whole list exactly if you have the perfect
cryptographically signed log of every single move ever made from event 0 to event n you can mathematically
reconstruct the state of the board at any point in time you don't need the platform to tell you the
state you can calculate it yourself from the history so if i have the log i own the reality
of the game i don't need the board yes and this is what enables the exit protocol this is the part of
the paper that reads like a constitution laying out the rights for a new kind of internet get out of jail
free card okay walk us through the three phases of this protocol so phase one is total log export
the platform fliction calls them the arbiter must be legally and more importantly technically required
to give you the signed log of your entire history not a zip file of photos the mathematical proof of
your interactions in order okay so i go to the arbiter and i say give me my moves and they have to give me
a file that proves i said this at 10 a.m and then my friend replied at 10 0 5 a.m correct and it's
cryptographically signed so it's verifiable phase two is verification you or maybe a new host that
you want to move to you replay those events you run the math does move one actually lead to move two
is the cryptographic signature valid you verify the chain is unbroken so i know the history hasn't
been tampered with it's real and phase three resumption a new arbiter a new host picks up the log
where the old one left off and accepts the next move from you so okay going back to the chess analogy
i'm playing on platform a they start showing me ads for lemon cards between every single move
or they start hiding my moves from my friends i hate it right so i take my list of moves my log i walk
over to platform b i hand them the list and you resume the game from the exact same board position
no data loss no social death you've just switched venues your history travels with you that changes
the power dynamic completely it's a total inversion it turns the platform from a king into a utility it
turns them into a glorified hosting provider the paper defines this through what it calls an arbiter
client contract which is based on negative rights negative rights that usually means things the
government can't do to you like congress shall make no law so what can the platform not do in this new
system there are two main axioms the first one axiom c1 is causal monotonicity monotonicity there's
that math language again what's that it's simpler than it sounds it just means time only moves forward
they cannot rewrite the past they cannot gaslight you they can't say oh you didn't post that
the log is a mathematical proof that you did they can't delete history okay that's huge and the
second one axiom c.2 is informational non-interference this means they can sequence your
post they can put it in the timeline but they cannot touch the bytes inside it they can't edit
your speech they can't modify the content of your message so if they can't lock me in and they can't
edit my history or my posts what happens if i just disagree with how they're running things
like what if the arbiter decides we don't allow pictures of cats anymore which you know would be
the end of the internet then you fork ah the forkability of time there it is this is the most
radical part of the whole proposal in open source code if you don't like how a project is being run
say the developers are making bad choices you just copy the code and you start your own new version that's
a fork right fliction says we should be able to do this with reality so we could have two different
timelines branching off from the exact same past yes let's say an arbiter decides to ban a certain
political topic in the current world you're just silenced or you're banned in a sphere pop world you
take your history you fork to a new arbiter that allows that topic and you just continue the conversation
and my friends can choose which branch of reality to follow exactly it turns political economy you
know all this arguing about censorship policies and begging ceos to be nice into distributed systems
theory power isn't about who owns the biggest servers anymore it's about who has the better math
and the better more attractive policy that is incredibly heavy it implies that reality isn't something
that mark zuckerberg or elon musk gives to us it's something we carry around in our pockets portable
history it's the digital equivalent of a soul you carry your continuity with you you possess your own
past okay so that solves the digital problem we escape the hostile interface by taking our ball which is our
history and going to a better playground but the deep dive doesn't stop there segment five
this where things got weirdly physical for me it connects the bits to the atoms a crucial leap the
paper draws a straight line from digital waste the spam the ads the cognitive pollution to physical
waste like the actual plastic islands floating in the ocean how does it make that connection flickson
argues they are fundamentally the same problem they are both open loop systems open loop meaning stuff goes
in one end turns into garbage and never comes back into the system correct in the digital realm the feed
injects noise that's attention leakage it fragments your mind and it gives nothing of value back in the
physical realm the exact same economic engine manufacturers cheap disposable goods and that's material leakage
the drop ship junk that is being advertised on the hostile interface the plastic toys the fast fashion
all of it exactly we dig up rare earth metals we turn them into a cheap toy we use it once and then we bury
it in a landfill it's an entropy machine but the paper has this brilliant definition of trash that i think
completely changes how you look at a garbage can okay it says trash is simply matter without metadata
matter without metadata wow that stuck with me too explain what that means okay think about a crushed
smartphone in a landfill technically it's a gold mine it has gold cobalt high-grade glass copper it's
incredibly valuable material but we treat it like garbage we just bury it we bury it because we don't
know what it is anymore it's just a crushed lump we have lost the information about its constituent materials
we don't know the exact alloy composition we don't know how to cleanly separate the glass from the screen
it has become illegible so just like the platform hides the history of our social interactions
which makes us socially dead if we leave the physical product hides its own composition which
makes it dead to the circular economy precisely we strip the data from the matter so the solution
fliction proposes is what they call steganographic material intelligence which sounds like some kind
of high-end spy attack ideally it would become completely mundane the proposal is that every
object should have its disassembly instructions and its exact composition hidden directly in its design
not a qr code you can just peel off no no embedded in the material itself they suggest things like
holographic tartans specific patterns readable by x-ray or optical scanners so a recycling center doesn't
just crush a blender anymore they scan it and the blender itself tells the machine i am made of these
three specific grades of plastic this gauge of copper wiring and here is exactly where you press to pop
the motor out cleanly yes the object becomes a legible material program if you know exactly what an object
is made of and exactly how to take it apart the cost of recycling drops to near zero it becomes an asset
again not garbage and this has to link back to the economics the paper suggests inverting the cost function
for manufacturing right now making unrecyclable mystery junk is cheap the disposal cost is externalized
to the planet we all pay for the land shell the company just pockets the profit so what's the
proposal material recovery bonds how would that work if your product is a black box a mystery box that
can't be easily recycled if it's opaque you pay a massive fee up front you essentially bond the future
cost of its disposal but if your product is transparent if it's legible and easy to disassemble you pay less
or maybe nothing at all this aligns the profit motive with material closure it closes the loop it makes
it profitable for companies to tell the truth about what they're selling so we have a unified theory here
it's almost elegant in its symmetry the hostile interface is an open loop of attention that
creates cognitive sludge right and the physical economy is an open loop of matter that creates
literal trash and the solution to both is legibility that is the synthesis that's the core of the whole
thing fliction calls it high fidelity realism high fidelity realism it sounds like a new kind of speaker
system but what it really means is just telling the truth it means treating reality both the
sequence of events in time and the composition of matter in space as a precious structure to be
preserved not as an obstacle to be manipulated or an ore to be extracted we're getting a little
philosophical here at the end which i like the paper references baudrillard and elif we have to i mean
we're living in what baudrillard called hyper reality the simulation the feed the ad the brand image
has completely replaced the reality we eat the image of the food we buy the image of the lifestyle and the
goal of sphere pop and material intelligence is to exit the simulation yes to make the underlying
structures time and matter public and verifiable again you can't fake the history log you can't fake
the material composition it's about stripping away all the marketing and the algorithmic manipulation
and just seeing the raw data of reality it's about truth it is civilizations collapse when their
accounting systems start to lie when you can't trust the ledger you can't do business and you can't
have a high trust society we need an accounting system that tells the truth about information that's
the sequence and about matter that's the waste it's a call for a new kind of honesty
honesty but it's not moral honesty we are asking ceos to suddenly become good people
we are asking for structural honesty mathematical honesty civilizational stakes the paper calls it
and i think that's right if we continue with this extractive design mining our brains for attention
and mining the earth for cheap plastic we hit a wall the hostility we feel in the interface
that sinky feeling in your stomach you started with yeah that is just the warning signal that we've hit
the limit so okay let's wrap this up this was a lot we started with that gross feeling of scrolling
through a hostile feed we analyzed the incentive inversion that causes it the lemons market for ads we
looked at why we're trapped the monopoly on time the escape plan then we found a digital escape hatch and
sphere pop and the exit protocol and then amazingly we found the physical escape hatch in legible matter
the big takeaway is that the frustration you feel isn't a glitch it's a signal the next step isn't
just asking these companies to be nicer or hoping for better moderation it's a fundamental change in
the physics of the internet it's about owning your own past so you can actually build your own future
so here is the final thought i want to leave you with it's a question that's been nagging at me ever
since i read the fork ability of time it's a personal one let's hear it if this technology
actually works if your digital history your memories your connections your entire past were truly yours
to carry in your pocket like a physical object where would you choose to live would you stay in
the walled garden just because it's safe and easy or would you fork reality and try to build something
new and if you did fork reality who would come with you exactly the ultimate test of friendship hey
i'm forking reality are you coming a fascinating prospect to think about thanks for diving deep
with us today this is a heavy one but hopefully the world looks a little more legible now keep your
history safe see you next time
