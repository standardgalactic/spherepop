# Spherepop

**Spherepop is an event-driven, visual and formal framework for building meaning, computation, and structure through irreversible actions.**

Instead of starting from *sets, states, or representations*, Spherepop starts from **events**: things that happen once, change what is possible next, and leave an auditable history behind.

At its core, Spherepop replaces static foundations with a **constructive, history-based mereology** (part–whole relations built over time).

## What Spherepop Is

Spherepop is simultaneously:

- a **formal calculus** for event-sourced structure,
- a **visual programming model** based on nested scopes (“bubbles”),
- and a **foundational alternative** to set-theoretic thinking.

Meaning, identity, and computation arise from *what has been done*, not from timeless axioms.

## Core Ideas (Short Version)

### 1. Events before objects
Nothing exists by assumption. Objects, relations, and identities exist **only if introduced by events**.

### 2. Part–whole instead of membership
Spherepop replaces set membership (`∈`) with a **time-indexed part-of relation**, built incrementally from events.

### 3. Event-sourced semantics
All structure arises from a replayable log of irreversible operations:

- **Pop** — eliminate an option by resolving it  
- **Refuse** — exclude an option by commitment  
- **Bind** — impose dependency without elimination  
- **Collapse** — identify distinctions to simplify history  
- **Meld** — synthesize parallel histories into one future  

Existence is historical, not axiomatic.

### 4. Identity is historical
Two things are the same if they have the same event history.  
There is no notion of identity independent of construction.

### 5. No classical paradoxes
Russell-style paradoxes cannot arise because Spherepop has:

- no global membership relation,
- no unrestricted comprehension,
- no predicate-generated objects.

If something exists, you can point to the event that made it.

### 6. Scales with reality, not hypotheticals
Spherepop replaces power sets and hypothetical infinity with **linear event logs**.  
Complexity grows with *what actually happens*, not with what could have happened.

## Spherepop as a Visual Language

Spherepop also exists as an **interactive visual system**.

- Expressions are drawn as **nested bubbles** (scopes).
- Each bubble represents a local context or subexpression.
- **Popping a bubble** explicitly evaluates that scope.
- Computation proceeds by deliberate traversal, not automation.

This makes scope, order of evaluation, and dependency *visible*.

## Why This Matters

Spherepop is motivated by a simple observation:

> Real systems—cognitive, computational, social—are not defined by states.  
> They are defined by **irreversible history**.

By making commitment, exclusion, synthesis, and abstraction explicit, Spherepop provides:

- a clearer model of computation,
- a more faithful account of agency,
- and a foundation aligned with how real systems evolve.

## Status

Spherepop is an active research and design project exploring:

- formal foundations,
- visual programming,
- semantic merging and abstraction,
- and new models of generative computation.

It is intentionally experimental, conceptual, and executable.
