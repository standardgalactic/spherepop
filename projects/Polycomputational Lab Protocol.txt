Excellent — let's expand Section 6: Towards a Polycomputational Lab into a more detailed and practical research protocol that blends Michael Levin-style bioelectric modeling with RSVP's scalar-vector-entropy dynamics, while keeping things precise and implementation-ready.

6. Towards a Polycomputational Lab

A polycomputational laboratory is not defined by its materials (cells, circuits, cities), but by its methods: identifying field dynamics, constraint propagations, and boundary negotiations in multiscale systems. This section outlines a systematic, repeatable pipeline for modeling, analyzing, and engineering such systems.

🔬 6.1 Core Modeling Pipeline

Step	Description	Formalization

1. Field Identification	Map system components to scalar (Φ), vector (𝒗), and entropy (S) fields.	e.g., Φ = voltage, 𝒗 = flow of charge, S = patterning entropy
2. Boundary Specification	Define physical, symbolic, or emergent boundaries where dynamics change.	Dirichlet/Neumann BCs, dynamic interface rules
3. Coupled Field Dynamics	Formulate PDEs encoding field evolution and coupling.	∂Φ/∂t = ∇²Φ - α∇·𝒗 + f₁(Φ,𝒗,S), etc.
4. Recursive Tiling / Simulation	Implement using multiscale recursive domains (e.g., TARTAN).	Adaptive mesh, symbolic tiling, vector attention
5. Morphogenetic Metric Extraction	Measure system-level properties: coherence, entropy flux, etc.	φ_RSVP, ΔS_total, coupling strength

🧪 6.2 Implementation Details

⚙️ Field Encoding (Levin + RSVP)

Bioelectric:

Φ: Membrane potential field (Vm)

𝒗: Directed gap junction flows

S: Differentiation entropy (Shannon over cell states)


Urban or symbolic systems:

Φ: Resource, salience, or signal pressure

𝒗: Agent movement, logic flows

S: System disorder, uncertainty, ambiguity



🧵 Recursive Tiling with TARTAN

Define tiles as microdomains with local Φ/𝒗/S evolution.

Allow tile inheritance, semantic annotations (e.g., "neural crest-like" vs. "traffic node").

Recursively apply constraint relaxation and vector updates.


📊 Morphogenetic Metrics

Coherence (C):

Measures global alignment of scalar potential.

Entropy Flux (Jₛ):

Measures how entropy gradients drive vector flows.

Morphogenetic Resolution (μ):
Rate of differentiation or system elaboration across scales.

🧭 6.3 Example Protocol: Bioelectric Embryo Simulation

1. Tissue Geometry: Create 2D hexagonal lattice representing epithelial sheet.


2. Initialize Fields:

Φ: Uniform potential + noise

𝒗: Randomized junctional flow vectors

S: Zero (undifferentiated)



3. Define Dynamics:









4. Boundary Conditions:

Fix Φ at edges to simulate external signaling gradients.

Allow 𝒗 to zero out at boundaries or reflect.



5. Run TARTAN Tiling:

Recursive zoom into unstable patches.

Annotate tiles with emerging "cell fates".



6. Measure:

Entropy flow and pattern coherence.

Number of stable attractors (interpreted as organs or symbolic roles).

Absolutely — here's an expanded, rigorous, and implementation-ready version of
Section 6: Towards a Polycomputational Lab
, refining each subcomponent to support hands-on experimentation with
RSVP-style field dynamics
and
Levin-inspired bioelectric modeling
, while allowing generalization to symbolic and urban systems.
6. Towards a Polycomputational Lab
A
polycomputational laboratory
is not defined by its substrate—cells, circuits, code—but by its
field-aware methodology
. This methodology integrates multiscale analysis, constraint propagation, and morphogenetic computation to model systems where structure and function co-evolve. RSVP's scalar-vector-entropy field formalism aligns naturally with Michael Levin's bioelectric paradigm, offering a unified protocol for both biological and symbolic computation.

🧵 Recursive Tiling via TARTAN
Each
tile
is a discrete cell-like domain with its own Φ, 𝒗, and S evolution rules. Tiling is recursive: unstable or high-entropy regions spawn finer subdivisions.
Tiling Features
:
Inheritance
: Tiles inherit initial field values from parent domain.
Annotation
: Attach symbolic labels (e.g., "axon hillock," "transit hub").
Constraint Relaxation
: Use energy minimization or flow convergence as update condition.
Vector Updates
: 𝒗-fields propagate based on Φ gradients or entropy gradients.
