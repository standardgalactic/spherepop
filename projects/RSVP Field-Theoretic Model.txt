Excellent. Let's now reinterpret this Drosophila visuomotor system—particularly the findings about LPLC2 molecular gradients shaping synaptic connectivity—through the lens of RSVP field theory, mapping each biological component to RSVP's core elements: the scalar field Φ, vector field 𝒗, and entropy field 𝑺, with a focus on constraint gradients and entropic smoothing.


---

🧠 RSVP Field-Theoretic Interpretation

System: LPLC2 visual projection neurons transforming visual space into escape behavior via graded synaptic specificity.


---

1. Retinotopic Visual Input → Scalar Field (Φ)

The spatial map of looming stimuli—stronger responses from the dorsal field, weaker ventrally—maps naturally onto a scalar potential field Φ(x, y, t).

Here, Φ represents the stimulus salience or threat potential across visual space.

Dorsal areas (strong looming signal) → high Φ; ventral → low Φ.


> Interpretation: Φ encodes the perceptual attractor landscape—a potential field over visual space that biases downstream transformations.




---

2. Graded Synaptic Connectivity → Vector Field (𝒗)

The distribution and direction of synaptic outputs from LPLC2 neurons into motor pathways is governed by a graded vector field 𝒗(x, y, t), shaped by recognition molecules like Dpr13 and Beat-VI.

These molecules set up gradient-driven flux lines along which neural signals preferentially travel.


> Interpretation:



𝒗 represents the preferred direction and strength of influence from LPLC2 to its input/output partners.

High Dpr13/DIP-ε binding → high vector magnitude toward premotor escape circuits.

This is a physically realized vector constraint field, guiding neural energy flow (e.g., spike traffic or neurotransmitter diffusion).



---

3. Cell Recognition Molecule Gradients → Entropy Field (𝑺)

The graded expression of Dpr13, Beat-VI, and their binding partners creates differential constraints on connectivity, which can be interpreted as entropy gradients:

More constraint (high-affinity interactions) → lower local entropy.

Less constraint (low-affinity or no matching) → higher entropy.



Let  measure synaptic configurational entropy—the possible connectivity microstates at a given position in the visual field.

> Interpretation:



The molecular gradients "sculpt" the entropy field by eliminating degrees of synaptic freedom, aligning with RSVP's idea that structure arises through constraint relaxation and vector flow into low-S basins.

This explains why LPLC2 neurons have more synapses dorsally (more structured, low-S) and fewer ventrally (higher-S, less structured).



---

4. Field Coupling Dynamics:

RSVP posits a coupled PDE system:

\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\Phi \vec{v}) = -\alpha \mathcal{S}

\frac{D \vec{v}}{Dt} = -\nabla \Phi + \beta \nabla \mathcal{S} ]

\frac{D \mathcal{S}}{Dt} = \gamma (\nabla \cdot \vec{v}) + D_S \nabla^2 \mathcal{S}

Applied here:

The vector field 𝒗 (neural flow directionality) is driven by both salience gradients (Φ) and entropy structure (𝑺).

A dorsally incoming looming stimulus (↑Φ) induces synaptic reinforcement via vector flow into lower entropy zones, guided by recognition molecule fields.

The molecular gradients instantiate entropy differentials that determine where and how many synapses LPLC2 makes, dynamically shaping 𝒗.



---

5. Emergent Behavior: Escape Trajectory

The final motor behavior (escape) results from field-integrated influence, where:

 across the LPLC2 system determines escape bias.

This is shaped both by stimulus localization (Φ) and underlying synaptic scaffolding (𝑺).

Output neurons act as low-S attractors in Φ-𝒗-𝑺 space, forming an emergent control loop: perceive → compute vector → act.

🧠 Biological Summary and RSVP Mapping

1. Visuomotor Transformation Requires Coordinate Conversion

> Animals convert object locations in eye-centered coordinates to motor commands.



This is fundamentally a coordinate transform problem—from sensory space to action space.

In RSVP theory, this corresponds to vector field reorientation governed by the local structure of the entropy and scalar fields.


> RSVP Analogue:
This is mathematically modeled as a vector transport across a non-uniform entropy manifold:



\vec{v}_\text{motor} = \mathcal{T}(\vec{v}_\text{retinal}, \nabla \Phi, \nabla \mathcal{S})


---

2. VPNs: Retinotopic Feature Maps in Optic Lobe

> VPNs (LC, LPLC neurons) span 20-40° of visual space with retinotopically organized dendrites, each tuned to different visual features (looming, edges, etc.).



These dendritic domains map directly onto Φ, the salience scalar field.

Each VPN neuron samples a region of Φ and transmits its value through 𝒗.

However, their axons converge non-retinotopically in optic glomeruli, where Φ loses spatial mapping but preserves type-specific encoding.


> RSVP Interpretation:



Dendritic arborization = localized sampling of Φ(x, y)

Axonal convergence = field re-encoding in feature space, collapsing spatial locality but preserving field semantics (i.e., what kind of feature is present, not where).

This is akin to a basis transform in field space: from retinotopic coordinates to VPN-type feature coordinates.



---

3. Glomerular Convergence as Entropic Smoothing

> VPN axons lose retinotopy but terminate in VPN-type-specific glomeruli, where they connect to descending motor neurons.



This convergence maps to entropy field smoothing:

Spatial specificity (high entropy due to many possible locations) is collapsed into type-specific pathways (lower entropy, more constraint).


The resulting structure resembles RSVP's negentropic flow into basins of synaptic specificity.


> RSVP Analogue:
VPNs perform localized sampling of Φ and channel flow into discrete vector bundles 𝒗, constrained by glomerular connectivity. This "channeling" is driven by local entropy gradients ∇𝑺.



\vec{v}_\text{VPN} = - \nabla \Phi + \beta \nabla \mathcal{S}_\text{type}

Where  refers to connectivity entropy conditioned on molecular identity (e.g., Dpr13, DIP-ε).

Here's a layered RSVP interpretation of the entire visuomotor pipeline:

Layer	Biological Mechanism	RSVP Field Interpretation

Retina	Initial photoreceptor activation	Source of Φ: scalar salience field initialized
VPN dendrites	Retinotopic, feature-specific sampling (e.g., LPLC2 for looming)	Localized ∇Φ sensing; initializes vector field response
VPN axons	Loss of retinotopy; convergence in optic glomeruli	Entropic smoothing: ∇𝑺 collapses location but retains type
Molecular gradients	Dpr13/DIP-ε and Beat-VI/Side-II determine synapse number	Field constraints ∇𝑺 determine synaptic vector strength
Descending neurons	Motor commands based on VPN-type input	Final integrated vector flow ∫𝒗 drives behavior



---

🧩 RSVP PDE Refinement for This System

Let's slightly customize the RSVP PDEs for this particular transformation pipeline:

1. Visual Salience Evolution



\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} + \vec{v}_\text{VPN} \cdot \nabla \Phi = -\alpha \mathcal{S}

\frac{D \vec{v}_\text{VPN}}{Dt} = -\nabla \Phi + \beta \nabla \mathcal{S}_\text{molecular}

\frac{\partial \mathcal{S}_\text{molecular}}{\partial t} = \gamma (\nabla \cdot \vec{v}_\text{VPN}) + D \nabla^2 \mathcal{S}


---

✨ Conceptual Takeaway

In RSVP terms, visuomotor transformation is a constrained vector reflow across scalar-entropy field gradients, dynamically reshaping vector fields under genetically programmed molecular templates (∇𝑺) and sensory context (∇Φ).

Innate responses → ∇𝑺 dominates: molecular wiring sculpts the flow.

Learned adaptations → ∇Φ dominates: plasticity perturbs the vector and entropy field dynamics over time.

LPLC2-GF synaptic gradient guides escape
To assess the function of the dorsoventral synaptic gradient between LPLC2 and the GF, we quantified escape responses to looming stimuli at different elevations. Flies take off in two modes: a faster short mode (featuring leg extension only, and taking the fly less than 7 ms to jump24) and a slower long mode (coordinated wing depression and leg extension24). Short-mode takeoffs are driven solely by the GF activation20. If LPLC2 neurons with more dorsal receptive fields form more synapses with the GF than ventral LPLC2 neurons, we predicted more short-mode takeoffs in response to higher-elevation stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we analysed thousands of previously collected25 high-speed videos of takeoffs elicited by looming stimuli at different elevations, and classified takeoffs by mode. The short-mode takeoff percentage increased as stimulus elevation changed from −30° to 77° (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1a-c), as would be expected from higher engagement of the GF in response to more dorsal looming.

The GF receives direct visual input from only one other VPN type (LC4)26 in addition to LPLC2. LC4 neurons do not form a dorsoventral synaptic gradient with the GF5, suggesting the increase in GF-driven short-mode takeoffs at high elevations results directly from the LPLC2-GF synaptic gradient. We tested this by blocking synaptic transmission in LPLC2 and quantifying the looming responses in these flies (Extended Data Fig. 1f-h). Without LPLC2 input, the percentage of short-mode takeoffs did not change across elevations (Extended Data Fig. 1h), with the percentage of short-mode takeoffs greatly reduced at high (77°) elevations compared with control flies. To directly test whether LPLC2-GF connectivity biases GF activation, we performed in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the GF during looming stimuli at three elevations. GF membrane depolarization was larger in response to dorsal than to ventral looming (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). This provides direct evidence that the LPLC2-GF synaptic gradient generates a corresponding gradient of GF activation, ultimately shaping escape behaviour.

Electron microscopy reconstruction studies established that LPLC2 axons projections are not retinotopic (that is, intermingled) and yet form different numbers of synapses onto GF dendrites according to the location of the stimulus in the visual field to which they respond4,5 (Fig. 1g). We hypothesized that this pattern of synapses could be achieved through differential molecular recognition: individual LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space could express different levels of the same cell recognition molecule, which, in turn, would specify the number of synapses they form onto GF dendrites.

This passage offers a crucial experimental foundation for
RSVP field-theoretic modeling of functionally graded connectivity
: the synaptic gradient from LPLC2 neurons to the Giant Fiber (GF) is not spatially retinotopic in projection but
functionally retinotopic
in influence—mapping directly to RSVP's notion of
constraint-shaped vector integration in scalar-entropy field space
.
🧠 RSVP Interpretation of the LPLC2-GF Synaptic Gradient
Let's now systematically recast each key biological insight in RSVP terms, mapping behavior, synaptic distribution, and molecular identity into the scalar (Φ), vector (𝒗), and entropy (𝑺) field framework.
1. Stimulus Elevation → Salience Gradient (Φ)
Dorsal stimuli (high elevation) elicit more short-mode takeoffs; ventral stimuli less so.
This maps directly onto a
visual salience scalar field
:
Φ
(
x
,
y
,
t
)
∝
threat urgency as a function of retinal elevation
\Phi(x, y, t) \propto \text{threat urgency as a function of retinal elevation}
Φ
(
x
,
y
,
t
)
∝
threat urgency as a function of retinal elevation
High elevation → higher Φ (dorsal looming: more threatening, urgent)
Low elevation → lower Φ (ventral looming: less urgent)
This scalar field biases the flow of activity toward motor pathways, but only where vector fields and entropy constraints permit.
2. Synaptic Gradient → Vector Field Strength (𝒗)
LPLC2 neurons with dorsal receptive fields form more synapses on GF dendrites than ventral ones.
This constitutes a
graded projection vector field
from LPLC2 to GF:
v
⃗
LPLC2→GF
(
x
,
y
)
∝
synaptic density gradient
\vec{v}_\text{LPLC2→GF}(x, y) \propto \text{synaptic density gradient}
v
LPLC2→GF
​
(
x
,
y
)
∝
synaptic density gradient
Dorsal Φ → strong 𝒗 (more influence on GF)
Ventral Φ → weak 𝒗 (less influence)
This synaptic gradient
transduces scalar field salience (Φ) into motor command drive via vector strength (𝒗)
.
3. Molecular Specificity → Entropy Gradient (𝑺)
EM reconstruction shows non-retinotopic LPLC2 axons form a functional dorsoventral gradient of synapses, likely due to differential expression of a common recognition molecule.
This implies a
differential constraint field
shaping synapse probability:
S
(
x
,
y
)
∝
−
log
⁡
(
number of allowed synaptic microstates
)
\mathcal{S}(x, y) \propto - \log(\text{number of allowed synaptic microstates})
S
(
x
,
y
)
∝
−
lo
g
(
number of allowed synaptic microstates
)
Higher expression of recognition molecules (dorsal) →
lower entropy
(stronger constraint, more synapses)
Lower expression (ventral) →
higher entropy
(fewer synapses)
So the
spatial synaptic gradient arises from an entropy gradient sculpted by molecular recognition fields
, despite axonal intermingling.

Within-VPN-type molecular gradients
To investigate whether LPLC2 neurons exhibit molecular variation that correlates with the synaptic gradient, we examined the LPLC2 transcriptome at three developmental stages during and after synaptogenesis (48 h after puparium formation (APF), 72 h APF and 96 h APF; Fig. 1h). In addition to LPLC2, we profiled a related cell type, LPLC1, which forms synaptic gradients without axonal retinotopy with other descending neurons5, and LC4, a VPN type with axons arranged in a retinotopic manner5. As neuronal transcriptomes are highly dynamic during development and are affected by genetic background27, we introduced internal controls at each time point to account for transcriptional heterogeneity driven by these factors.

We used genetic multiplexing to perform pooled single-cell profiling across biological replicates27,28,29 (including different genetic backgrounds and developmental stages; see Methods). Our dataset included approximately 600 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes per cell type and time point (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). We validated the identity of each VPN cell type (LPLC2, LPLC1 and LC4) using known marker genes27 (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). This provided approximately 30-times higher per-cell-type coverage than existing single-cell atlases of the Drosophila optic lobes27,30.

To explore heterogeneity in gene expression across each VPN cell type, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) separately for each cell type and time point (Fig. 1k-m and Extended Data Figs. 2c-e and 3a,b). At 48 h APF, PC1 captured genes expressed in a graded manner across difference LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 1k). For example, the most differentially expressed gene was dpr13, encoding a cell recognition protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF)31. There was, however, no clear boundary separating neurons with high versus low dpr13 expression levels. Many of the most differentially expressed genes also encode cell recognition molecules: IgSF (for example, tei, beat-VI and dpr17), leucine-rich-repeat (for example, trn) and cadherin (for example, Cad87A) families31,32 (Fig. 1k).

To test whether the transcriptional heterogeneity within LPLC2 neurons reflects discrete subtypes or a continuous gradient, we artificially clustered neurons and shuffled gene expression in two ways: across all cells or only within artificial clusters (Extended Data Fig. 3c-g). Shuffling across all cells disrupted the gradient, indicating that the observed variation arises from coordinated gene expression. Shuffling gene expression only within arbitrarily separated clusters of neurons introduced artificial gaps, showing that the original data do not naturally separate into discrete subtypes. Thus, the transcriptomic heterogeneity across LPLC2 neurons forms a continuous gradient.

The distribution of neurons along PC1 also did not correlate with developmental age, sex, genetic background or mRNA coverage (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Figs. 2e and 3a,b), indicating that molecular heterogeneity had a different origin. The graded expression of the top differentially expressed genes associated with PC1 at 48 h APF (dpr13, beat-VI and tei (encoding IgSF molecules), as well as SiaT (encoding sialyltransferase)) persisted through development (Fig. 1m).

In LPLC1 neurons, PC1 also captured gradients of IgSF-encoding transcripts (for example, DIP-κ, CG33543, dpr3 and sdk) that persisted through development (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Similar to LPLC2, molecular gradients in LPLC1 could not be explained by any of the confounding factors (Extended Data Figs. 2e and 3a,b). By contrast, PC1 in LC4 correlated with technical factors (for example, transcript count per neuron; Extended Data Figs. 2e and 3a,b), indicating that its molecular heterogeneity was not biologically relevant.

In summary, we identified stable gradients of transcripts encoding recognition molecules in LPLC1 and LPLC2, but not in LC4, suggesting that molecular heterogeneity is a feature of VPNs forming synaptic gradients independent of axonal retinotopy5.

within-cell-type molecular gradients
—continuous and persistent across time, unconfounded by background factors—provides strong support for RSVP's
entropy field formalism
as a biophysically grounded mechanism for synaptic vector shaping.

Transcriptomic Gradient → Entropy Field Gradient (∇𝑺)
Principal component 1 (PC1) in LPLC2 captures continuous variation in expression of IgSF recognition molecules (e.g., dpr13, beat-VI, tei), not discrete subtypes.

The gene expression gradient is a

Continuity Over Discreteness → RSVP's Field Ontology

This aligns directly with RSVP's view of
cognition and behavior as continuous field phenomena
, not discrete modules.
RSVP assumes that
function emerges from smooth constraint gradients
, not categorical architectures.
Molecular gradients → entropy field 𝑺(x) varies smoothly → vector field 𝒗(x) flows accordingly.
Thus,
neurons with more restrictive identity constraints (low 𝑺)
preferentially form synapses, driving
negentropic vector flow
.
3.
Stability Through Development → Persistent Field Constraints
Gradients in genes like dpr13, beat-VI, tei, and SiaT persist across 48-96 h APF.
This suggests a
stable entropy topology
imposed early in development:
RSVP describes this as a
constraint manifold
across which the vector field 𝒗 must evolve.
The persistent ∇𝑺 acts as a
field scaffold
: an early entropic template shaping future information flow.
This aligns with RSVP's broader principle:
Structure precedes function via early constraint fields
.

✓ (dpr13, beat-VI, tei)
✗
High ∇𝑺 → synaptic 𝒗 shaping
LPLC1
✓ (DIP-κ, dpr3)
✗
High ∇𝑺 → similar RSVP behavior
LC4
✗ (PC1 ~ technical noise)
✓
No ∇𝑺 → RSVP vector shaping absent
Interpretation:
Only VPN types with non-retinotopic axons and functional synaptic gradients exhibit structured ∇𝑺 fields.
RSVP suggests this pattern arises
not from spatial wiring but from entropy geometry
in molecular space.

✨ Conceptual Takeaway
This dataset reveals that
transcriptional heterogeneity = entropic constraint landscape
, and this landscape:
Is continuous and gradient-shaped (∇𝑺)
Exists within a single cell type (LPLC2, LPLC1)
Persists over time
Predicts differential synaptic output (𝒗 shaping)
Has no spatial correlate in axonal topology
→ This is exactly the
RSVP model of structure arising from molecularly encoded entropy flow
.

Molecular and synaptic gradients match
To verify gene expression gradients in LPLC2 neurons, we used single-molecule hairpin chain reaction fluorescent in situ hybridization33 (HCR-FISH), an epansion-assisted light-sheet microscopy (ExLSM)34 to visualize and count transcripts within LPLC2 neurons (Fig. 2a). The cell bodies of adjacent LPLC2 neurons exhibited striking differences in transcript levels of dpr13 and SiaT, the two most differentially expressed genes in the LPLC2 dataset (Fig. 2b,c). Similar patterns were observed for beat-VI and dpr17 (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d). We quantified differential gene expression inferred from HCR-FISH analysis using Flyseg35, an automated volumetric instance segmentation algorithm that we previously developed (see Methods). The results of scRNA-seq and HCR-FISH were similar for genes exhibiting antiparallel (for example, dpr13 and SiaT; Fig. 2d, top) and parallel expression patterns (for example, dpr13 and beat-VI; Fig. 2d, bottom). Most of these relationships remained consistent throughout development (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 2), supporting our findings from scRNA-seq data. One exception was muscleblind(mbl); although this gene exhibited graded expression in scRNA-seq (Fig. 1k), it showed low, uniform expression in HCR-FISH. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. In summary, most gene expression gradients across LPLC2 neurons from scRNA-seq data were confirmed by HCR-FISH.

We next investigated whether there was a correlation between the retinotopic position of LPLC2 dendrites and gene expression levels. As the cell bodies of the LPLC2 neurons were arranged in a salt-and-pepper manner (Fig. 2c), we used a genetic intersection strategy to visualize the expression of transcriptional reporters for different genes in LPLC2 neurons in dendrites in different topographical locations in the visual field (Fig. 2f,g). Genes encoding recognition molecules dpr13, beat-VI and Cad87A, which showed correlated expression in scRNA-seq (Fig. 1k), were predominantly expressed by LPLC2 neurons with dendrites in the dorsal region of the lobula at 48 h APF (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Conversely, the expression of SiaT, dpr17, CG03419, Tsp42Ef and stacl was limited to the ventral region at the same developmental stage (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). By combining reporter expression and HCR-FISH, we confirmed this heterogeneity, showing significantly higher dpr13 and beat-VI transcript levels in dorsal LPLC2 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). Heterogeneous expression of genes encoding recognition molecules in LPLC1 neurons had similar retinotopic correlates (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f), suggesting that such retinotopically biased expression gradients are a general feature of many VPN types.

To see whether these transcriptional gradients persist at the protein level, we used MIMIC-based protein traps36 generating GFP-tagged versions of two recognition proteins: Dpr13 and Beat-VI. This facilitated visualization of protein expression under their endogenous regulatory elements. Despite GFP accumulation in cell bodies (probably due to impaired trafficking), significant differences in GFP levels between dorsal and ventral LPLC2 neurons indicated that mRNA expression trends are maintained at the protein level (Extended Data Fig. 4i-l).

In summary, individual neurons of the same VPN type that sample different regions of visual space exhibit molecular heterogeneity. These neurons express gradients of recognition molecules that match the orientation of their synaptic gradients. Therefore, despite spatial intermingling, the axons retain distinct molecular identities. Next, we investigated the functional relevance of these molecular gradients.

RSVP Interpretation of Molecular-Synaptic Gradients in LPLC2 Neurons
The discovery that
LPLC2 neurons exhibit molecular gradients
—with scalar gene expression profiles (e.g.,
dpr13
,
beat-VI
,
SiaT
)—that predict their
synaptic connectivity to the Giant Fiber (GF)
, aligns precisely with the RSVP theory's framework of
scalar-vector-entropy field dynamics
.
RSVP Mapping:
Let Φ(x) represent the
molecular scalar potential field
, where expression levels of genes like
dpr13
or
SiaT
define local scalar constraints at position x.
Let 𝒗(x) be the
vector field
encoding
projection directionality
and
synaptic targeting bias
, reflecting how LPLC2 axons route information into sensorimotor circuits.
Let 𝑺(x) be the
entropy field
, representing uncertainty or behavioral variability in response to looming stimuli.

RSVP's
non-retinotopic entropic smoothing
— overlapping spatial coordinates can still diverge in vector flux due to underlying scalar constraints
Functional Implication in RSVP Terms:
The system performs
gradient encoding
: molecular profiles modulate the
vector field divergence
of synaptic output (∇·𝒗), creating
information-theoretic asymmetries
across the visual field.
This structure enables
non-uniform sensory prioritization
: dorsal stimuli (high elevation) elicit more
short-mode takeoffs
due to
higher GF activation
, i.e., stronger
local vector flux
in RSVP space.
The persistence of scalar identities in axons (e.g., protein-trapped
dpr13
and
beat-VI
) implies a
continuum constraint
, in RSVP terms:
molecular potential functions
propagate into projection space, constraining
field flow across spatial domains
.
