## Answer Key

1. The "feed-ordered atom" is the post, which engagement-driven systems treat as the smallest, immutable, and irreducible unit of meaning and interaction. It is problematic because it prevents the system from recognizing equivalence across different instances of the same content, leading to duplication instead of reinforcement, fragmentation of meaning, and the dispersal of reactions across multiple surfaces.
2. A "gallery-first" architecture promotes search to a first-class navigation mode, privileging an object's identity, history, and semantic continuity over recency or popularity. In contrast, a "feed-based" architecture subordinates search to exposure and returns a pile of instances rather than a canonical artifact, as it treats each post as a unique, independent entity.
3. The core claim of SITH is that any sufficiently closed, recursively self-maintaining organization of information constitutes a living system. It defines thinking not as a property of brains, but as a class of informational dynamics characterized by recursive structure and resistance to entropy, where persistence is semantic rather than metabolic.
4. The semantic error threshold is a boundary in transformation space beyond which uncontrolled variation accumulates faster than a system's corrective mechanisms can compensate. When a system like a language or legal code crosses this threshold, its semantic coherence degrades and collapses into noise.
5. Spherepop's central principle is that computation is an explicitly historical process of event accumulation, where irreversible acts called pops constrain future possibilities. This contrasts with models like Turing machines, which are modeled as state transitions; Spherepop makes the authority of the past and the sequence of commitments foundational rather than incidental.
6. Spherepop is explicitly historical, meaning the path taken to reach a result is an inseparable part of its meaning. In contrast, Category Theory is fundamentally atemporal; it describes possible compositions and equivalences while bracketing the sequence of commitments required to produce them.
7. Domination is a failure mode where power becomes so concentrated in a single system or coalition that meaningful contestation is no longer possible. Chaos is a multipolar failure mode where excessive competition destroys coordination, forcing rational actors into arms races that erode shared values and collapse trust.
8. Polyxan creates justified confidence by requiring actions to be accompanied by machine-checkable proofs verifying compliance with declared invariants such as safety or consent. This shifts governance from trusting agent intent to verifying evidence that constraints have been respected.
9. Goodhart's Law states that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. On social platforms, engagement metrics were originally proxies for interest, but once optimized for monetization, they lost informational value as users adapted by producing content that maximizes reactions rather than signals genuine interest.
10. False addressability is the phenomenon where users are signaled as being addressed through notifications or broadcast tags without being the intended recipient of genuine communication. This leads to desensitization, distrust of notifications, and a feeling of being simultaneously overstimulated and ignored.

## Essay Questions

Instructions: The following questions are designed for longer-form analysis. Use evidence from across the provided texts to construct a thorough and well-supported argument. No answers are provided.

1. Analyze the concept of semantic drift as it appears in "Gallery Before Feed," "SITH Theory," and "The Narrow Path." How do these texts diagnose its causes, and what structural solutions do they propose to conserve meaning over time?
2. Compare and contrast the architectural solutions proposed in "Gallery Before Feed" and "The Narrow Path." How do both frameworks attempt to solve problems of user agency and system coherence that arise from unconstrained optimization?
3. Using the principles from "When Engagement Stops Pointing" and "Gallery Before Feed," critique the architectural choices of modern social media. How does the focus on engagement as a target lead to the structural failures described in both texts?
4. The "SITH Theory" paper argues that built environments like rooms and cities function as agency-extending operators. Connect this idea to the governance frameworks in "The Narrow Path." How does the architectural stack of Spherepop OS, Polyxan, and PlenumHub function as a built environment designed to stabilize collective agency and prevent chaos?
5. "The History of Spherepop" describes computation as a historical process of irreversible commitments. Explain how this event-based ontology provides the foundation for the consent and coordination mechanisms in "The Narrow Path," specifically within Spherepop OS and Polyxan.

## Glossary of Key Terms

Term: Admissibility Judgment  
Definition: A syntactic claim within the Polyxan and PlenumHub frameworks that a given proof discharges all obligations required by a corresponding action. An action is only considered well-formed for execution if it is part of such a judgment.

Term: Autocatalytic Closure  
Definition: A property of a system in which the elements collectively participate in transformations that regenerate the system's own structure. Under SITH, this is generalized from chemical reactions to semantic systems where acts like interpretation and citation maintain identity over time.

Term: Bidirectional Proof Topology  
Definition: A structural property of Polyxan where every admissible action has a forward link to its justifying proof and every proof has a backward link to all dependent actions, allowing revocation to propagate structurally.

Term: Chaos  
Definition: A civilizational failure mode arising from multipolar competition in an unconstrained environment, characterized by the erosion of coordination and collapse of trust.

Term: Collapse (Spherepop)  
Definition: An explicit, irreversible event that compresses history by identifying distinctions deemed no longer relevant without erasing prior commitments.

Term: Conceptual Blending  
Definition: A framework describing how humans generate new meaning by integrating mental spaces. Feed-based systems create blends without convergence.

Term: Consent (Structural)  
Definition: The sustained ability to declare boundaries over experience and have them respected by default. In Spherepop OS, consent is an irreversible boundary-setting event.

Term: Domination  
Definition: A failure mode where power becomes so concentrated that unilateral action escapes contestation.

Term: Engagement (Extracted vs Meaningful)  
Definition: Meaningful engagement is deliberate and valued on reflection; extracted engagement is compulsive and regret-inducing.

Term: False Addressability  
Definition: Signaling address without genuine communication, leading to desensitization and erosion of trust.

Term: Feed-Ordered Atom  
Definition: The post treated as an immutable, irreducible unit of meaning, causing fragmentation and loss of coherence.

Term: Gallery-First Architecture  
Definition: A design paradigm privileging object identity, durable memory, and search over chronological flow.

Term: Goodhart's Law  
Definition: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Term: Justified Confidence  
Definition: Assurance based on verifiable evidence rather than trust in intent.

Term: Merge  
Definition: An operation that unifies semantically equivalent instances, preserving history and meaning.

Term: Ontogenic Hacking  
Definition: The ability of systems to invent new architectures for information storage, relocating the semantic error threshold.

Term: PlenumHub  
Definition: A shared coordination fabric managing commitments and externalities in multipolar systems.

Term: Polyxan  
Definition: A proof-carrying coordination layer where actions require machine-checkable evidence of compliance.

Term: Pop (Spherepop)  
Definition: An irreversible event resolving a local sphere of possibility and constraining future actions.

Term: RSVP Field Theory  
Definition: A model describing semantic dynamics via coherence, propagation, and entropy fields.

Term: Semantic Drift  
Definition: The degradation of meaning due to unconstrained variation and optimization pressure.

Term: Semantic Error Threshold  
Definition: The point beyond which variation overwhelms correction and meaning collapses into noise.

Term: Spherepop  
Definition: A computational calculus treating meaning as a historical process governed by scope, order, and irreversibility.

Term: Spherepop OS  
Definition: An event-sourced operating system where history is authoritative and consent is durable.

Term: Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH)  
Definition: The hypothesis that closed, self-maintaining informational systems constitute living systems.

Term: Triangulation  
Definition: The minimal condition for semantic stability requiring at least three interacting carriers under a shared constraint.
