# Abstraction as Reduction: A Unified Account of Computation, Logic, and Physics

---

## Preface

Abstraction is routinely described as the operation that conceals mechanism, suppresses detail, and erects the modular boundaries required for coherent construction. Yet this familiar picture, though pedagogically useful, obscures the deeper phenomenon. This monograph argues that abstraction is, in fact, a form of **computational reduction**. It is not the negation of detail but the successful execution of detail—the terminus of a computational process that permits the emergence of higher-order descriptions and makes composition possible.

This unity of abstraction and reduction is a structural invariant, a pattern found across a remarkable range of disciplines. Lambda calculus reduction, the discipline of functional type signatures, the stabilization of asynchronous dual-rail circuits, the mereological ascent from parts to wholes, and the structural constraints of category theory all exhibit the same invariant logic: an inner structure is resolved, stabilized, or normalized so that an outer structure may compose without energetic or epistemic conflict.

**To abstract is to evaluate.  
To evaluate is to normalize.  
To normalize is to prove.**

## Introduction

Abstraction is the stabilization of an underlying computational process, not the passive creation of an interface. A structure becomes abstractable precisely when its internal dependencies have been satisfied and need not be revisited. The surface becomes available because the depth has been executed.

## Part I: Formal Systems

### Chapter 1: Lambda Calculus

Abstraction and reduction coincide in the lambda calculus. A normal form is a complete abstraction: a structure whose internal obligations have been discharged.

### Chapter 2: Types and Interfaces

Type signatures act as behavioral certificates summarizing completed reductions. Parametricity and contracts enforce abstraction as discipline.

### Chapter 3: Asynchronous Circuits

In Null Convention Logic, abstraction appears only after physical stabilization. A value becomes abstractable precisely when computation completes.

### Chapter 4: Curry–Howard

Proof normalization and program evaluation are identical acts. Abstract proofs are normalized proofs.

## Part II: Structure and Cognition

### Chapter 5: Category Theory

Objects are defined by morphisms. Abstraction is structural role, not substance.

### Chapter 6: Mereology

Wholes emerge when parts stabilize. Abstraction is boundary discipline.

### Chapter 7: Algebra and Haskell

An abstraction is the reduction of an entity to its stable affordances.

### Chapter 8: Cognitive Architecture

Human abstraction is internalized reduction. Teaching abstraction is an ethical act.

## Part III: Philosophy and Ethics

### Chapter 9: Against Phenomenological Reduction

Phenomenology restores what abstraction removes. The two reductions diverge.

### Chapter 10: Ethics of Reduction

When abstraction becomes extraction, reality becomes disposable. Responsibility must be exogenous.

## Part IV: Physics and Geometry

### Chapter 11: Spherepop Calculus

Spherepop replaces membership with event-induced parthood.

### Chapter 12: Geometry of Meaning

Belief is position on a semantic manifold. Abstraction is compression.

### Chapter 13: Physics of Computation

Reduction is energy descent in an RSVP–Ising plenum.

## Conclusion

β-reduction ≡ Spherepop collapse ≡ Turing transition ≡ Neural propagation ≡ Hamiltonian minimization ≡ Semantic abstraction

**Abstraction is the geometry of computation.  
Computation is the geometry of meaning.  
Meaning is the geometry of the plenum.**
